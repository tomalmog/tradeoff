        "description": "On March 14, 2022, Do Kwon (@stablekwon) and Sensei Algod (@AlgodTrading) made a bet on whether the price of Terra (LUNA) would be lower on March 14, 2023 than it was on March 14, 2022. \n\nEach party put up 1 million, to an escrow wallet owned by @cobie. Do Kwon bet LUNA would be $92.40 or higher on March 14, 2023, and Sensei Algod bet LUNA would be lower than $92.40.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Do Kwon” if Do Kwon wins the bet, or “Sensei Algod” if Sensei Algod wins the bet.\n\nIf for whatever reason the winner of the bet isn’t decided by April 1, 2023, or is ambiguous (e.g. the result isn't agreed to by both parties and @cobie), LUNA’s 24h average price on March 14, 2023, ET will be checked. If it is 92.40$ or above, the market will resolve to “Do Kwon”, otherwise it will resolve to “Sensei Algod”.\n\nThe 24h price will be calculated from Coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna), by averaging the close price of all forty-eight 30 minute candles for the timeframe March 14 12:00:00 AM ET to March 15 12:00:00 AM ET. If Coingecko’s relevant candles are unavailable, another credible source will be used.",

Inflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the index increased by more than 0.2 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from February to March 2024 and “No“ otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS March 2024 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on April 10, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%).
